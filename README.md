# integers_sextuple
Simple assembly program running on RARS 1.1
(RISC-V Assembler and Runtime Simulator)


<h3> How does this program work? </h3>

  1. Reads 8 integers from console input and stores them in an array[] in memory.
  2. Prints their sextuple in reverse order.
     (multiplication with 6 was implemented with 3 'add' instructions)
  3. Loops back to step 1.
